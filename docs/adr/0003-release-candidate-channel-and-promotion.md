# Release-candidate channel and promote-to-stable

June ships a second update channel, `rc`, alongside `stable` (ADR 0001). An RC is
built on demand at a prerelease version, published to a fixed `rc` release in
`open-software-network/os-june-releases`, and tested through the in-app updater.
When it is good it is **promoted** to stable by rebuilding the same source at a
clean version. There is no direct stable-build path: every stable release starts
life as an RC.

## Status

accepted - implemented in PR #529

## Context

ADR 0001 established a single stable auto-update track and, critically, that the
Tauri updater's manifest endpoint is selectable **only in Rust** (the JS
`check()` cannot override `endpoints`). We want to ship test builds to opt-in
users before stable without a second app, without weakening signature
verification, and without a manual-install step for testers.

Two forces shape the whole design:

- **Channel selection must live in Rust.** Since the endpoint is Rust-only, the
  update check and install both move into Rust commands (`fetch_update` /
  `install_update` in `src-tauri/src/updates.rs`); the live `Update` handle
  cannot cross IPC. The channel is a persisted setting (`release-settings.json`)
  read Rust-side, so a check can never disagree with the saved channel.
- **The updater's `version_comparator` closure is the sole install gate.** In
  `tauri-plugin-updater` there is no separate downgrade block and no
  `allow_downgrades` on the Rust builder; returning `true` for an older remote
  installs a downgrade. Every install-decision rule therefore has to be expressed
  through that one closure.

## Decision

### Channels

`stable` follows `releases/latest/download/latest.json` (GitHub's `/latest`
redirect skips prereleases). `rc` follows a **fixed** `rc` release tag whose
`latest-rc.json` asset is overwritten each build, so the channel URL never moves.
Both inherit the same Ed25519 updater pubkey from `tauri.conf.json`, so signature
verification holds on both channels.

### Versioning (Q1-Q3)

- An RC is `X.Y.Z-rc.N` (semver prerelease). This orders `rc.1 < rc.2 < ... <
  X.Y.Z`, so a later candidate supersedes an earlier one and the eventual stable
  base supersedes them all.
- `main`'s version files bump **at promote, not at RC build**. RC versions are
  ephemeral (stamped into the build, never committed).
- Promote's clean version is the RC base with the `-rc.N` suffix dropped.

### Promote rebuilds from the recorded source (flavor B)

The RC records its exact source commit in an `rc-build.json` asset. Promote checks
out **that commit**, stamps the clean `X.Y.Z`, and reruns the full sign + notarize
path. Stable therefore ships the same source that was tested as the RC, with a
clean version string.

### Reconcile when leaving rc (Q4-Q8)

Switching the channel to `stable` while running a prerelease build offers a
**one-time, narrow downgrade** onto the current stable, because stable is normally
older than the RC you are on and a routine check would never pull it. The rule is
a pure function (`should_update`) wired into the `version_comparator`:

```
install if  remote > current                       (default, all routine checks)
        or  channel == Stable && reconcile && current.is_prerelease()
```

The escape is gated on `channel == Stable` and on a `reconcile` flag the frontend
sets **only** on the switch action, never on launch/periodic/manual checks. The
UI saves the channel immediately, then (if the running build is `-rc`) fetches the
stable version and shows a bespoke in-context confirm; the download reuses the
normal update flow, re-checking so a periodic check cannot leave a stale staged
update.

### Workflow gates (Q9, Q10)

- `rc-desktop-dmg.yml` rejects a `base-version` that is not strictly greater than
  `main`'s current version, so an RC can only ever target an unreleased version.
- `rc-desktop-dmg.yml` also rejects a composed `X.Y.Z-rc.N` that does not strictly
  exceed the version the `rc` release currently holds (allowing the first
  candidate when no `rc` release exists yet). The base-vs-`main` check alone
  ignores the rc iteration, so without this a rerun with an equal or lower
  `rc-number` would publish backward over the fixed channel URL and strand testers
  already on the higher build.
- `promote-desktop.yml` requires `rc-version` and fails unless it matches the RC
  release exactly, so a promote can never silently ship a different candidate.

### Windows builds from the promoted commit

`promote-desktop.yml` records the source commit in a `stable-build.json` asset on
the `vX.Y.Z` release. `production-desktop-windows.yml` reads that commit, checks
**it** out (not `main`), and stamps the clean version before building. macOS and
Windows therefore ship the same tested tree under one `vX.Y.Z`, even if `main`
advanced during the RC cycle, and the Windows build no longer depends on the
version-bump PR being merged first.

## Considered options

- **Promote by re-publishing the RC bytes as stable (flavor A)** (rejected). Would
  avoid a second build + notarize, but ships a binary whose internal version
  string is `X.Y.Z-rc.N`. Chose flavor B (rebuild clean) so the stable binary
  carries a clean version; accepted cost is one extra signed build.
- **Reconcile as a general stable rollback lever** (rejected). Chose the narrow
  prerelease-only escape (Q5): a bad stable release is fixed by rolling *forward*
  (`X.Y.Z+1`), never by installing an older stable. This keeps `stable -> stable`
  strictly forward-only and avoids a downgrade footgun.
- **Setting the escape comparator on the rc channel** (rejected). On `rc` the
  installed build is always a prerelease, so an unguarded escape would let `rc.2`
  "update" down to `rc.1` and destroy the Q1 ordering. The `channel == Stable`
  guard is load-bearing and is covered by a unit test.
- **P1 fix: gate promote to `BUILD_COMMIT == origin/main`** (rejected). Simpler,
  but forbids promoting a tested RC once any other PR merges to `main`. Chose to
  **decouple Windows from `main`** instead so `main` can advance freely during an
  RC cycle while both platforms still ship the RC commit.

## Consequences

- **Every channel is forward-only, enforced at three independent layers.** The
  updater's `should_update` gate (`remote > current`, except the guarded stable
  escape), the RC build's version-advance gate (composed `X.Y.Z-rc.N` must exceed
  the current `rc` release), and Q9 (`base-version > main`) each stop a different
  way the channel could move backward. No single layer covers all three; a build
  can pass Q9 yet still regress the `rc` channel, which is why the version-advance
  gate is separate.
- **No general stable rollback.** By design (Q5) there is no lever to push an
  older stable to users; recover from a bad stable by releasing forward.
- **Promote does a second full macOS build + notarize.** Slower than re-tagging,
  in exchange for a clean stable version string from tested source.
- **The version-bump PR is bookkeeping.** Merging `release: vX.Y.Z` advances
  `main`'s version files so the next RC's Q9 gate and the next changelog anchor
  work. Windows and the stable release no longer depend on it, so it can merge in
  parallel.
- **Post-RC commits merged during an RC cycle are not in that release.** They ship
  in a later release built from a future RC. Because the changelog anchors on the
  latest `release: v...` first-parent commit, such commits can fall between two
  changelogs; treat the changelog as a convenience, not a complete audit.
- **`stable-build.json` / `rc-build.json` are load-bearing release metadata.** A
  promote or Windows run reads them to learn the source commit; hand-editing or
  deleting them breaks the rebuild.
- **The escape rule must stay a tested pure function.** Its correctness is not
  observable from the updater builder, so `should_update` is unit-tested for the
  stable-escape, rc-forward-only, and clean-stable-forward-only cases.
